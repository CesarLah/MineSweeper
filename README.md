# MineSweeper

### Minesweeper game coded in Python

minesweeper.py

This is a basic mine sweeper game. This program allows you to choose the size of the grid where you will be playing, and to position the mines on the grid. 
Once you have done that, the program will check how many mines there are around each position.

This project was done to practise with 2-D lists. Firstly, it creates a NxM matrix (with dashes as elements) and then, it fills part of the matrix with mines 
(represented with hashtags). Finally, it will check every position surrounding each matrix element and will return a matrix where each element (except in the 
positions where the mines are) will contain the number of mines around them.

To use this program just download the file and run it on Python. You can use directly the console/command prompt to run it (typing python minesweeper.py in the
folder where you downloaded the file, if you have already installed Python)  or use any IDE (Spyder, VS Code, Jupyter Notebook, etc.) to run it and make any 
desired changes.
